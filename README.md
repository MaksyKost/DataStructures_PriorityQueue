Implementation and benchmarking of a priority queue in C++.

# Data Structures: Priority queue

This repository was created for the **Data Structures** course at **Wrocław University of Science and Technology**.

## 📌 Project Description
The goal of the project is to implement and benchmark two fundamental data structures in C++:

- **Dynamic Arrays**
- **Singly Linked Lists**

The project focuses on the comparison of their performance across various operations, analyzing time complexity and behavior with different input sizes.

---

## ⚙️ Implemented Operations

For both structures, the following operations are implemented and tested:

- `insert(i, e)` – insert element `e` at index `i`
- `delete(i)` – delete element at index `i`
- `find(e)` – search for element `e`
- `resize()` – (for dynamic arrays) dynamically grow or shrink the array
- `print()` – display all elements

---

## 🧪 Testing and Benchmarking

Each structure is tested for correctness and benchmarked using large datasets. The performance results are used to compare:

- Average and worst-case insert/delete times
- Search efficiency
- Memory usage patterns
